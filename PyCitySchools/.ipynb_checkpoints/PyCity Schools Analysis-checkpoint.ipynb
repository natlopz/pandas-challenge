    "Based on the relationship between the spending budget per student and their academic outcomes, we expect to see that higher spending per student directly correlates with better academic scores on subjects tested. However, with this data set, this is not the case. According to the \"Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\" data set, Cabrera High School resulted in first place with a $582 spending budget per student and an overall passing score of 91.33%. Compared to the ranking school in the \"Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)\" data set, Johnson High School resulted in a 650-dollar spending budget per student and scored an overall passing rate of 53.53%. These results indicate that how the school is spending their total budget brings more importance than how much they are spending. Furthermore, one can observe the impact of school size on student's academic performance and overall passing rates. Looking at the data we discussed above, Cabrera High School has a total student population of 1858 compared to Johnson Highschool with a total student population of 4761. Schools with fewer students may attribute to higher academic scores and passing rates where teachers can give more individual attention to students resulting in a student's higher chance of success. These observations highlighted in this analysis suggest that factors such as financial allocation and school size influence student's academic performance."
